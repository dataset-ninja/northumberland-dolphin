**NDD20: The Northumberland Dolphin Dataset 2020** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the environmental research, and in the robotics industry. 

The dataset consists of 4402 images with 6103 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*dolphin*).

Images in the Northumberland Dolphin dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 positions: ***above*** (2201 images) and ***below*** (2201 images), or into 2 dolphins species: ***tursiops truncatus*** (2668 objects) and ***lagenorhynchus albirostris*** (271 objects). Additionally, some labels marked with dolphin ***id*** and ***out of focus*** tags. The dataset was released in 2020 by the Newcastle University, UK.
